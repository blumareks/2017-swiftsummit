If you like it give me a star!

Welcome to the espresso style labs with Swift that connect to AI services of IBM Watson.
This course is based on the Massive Online Open Course (MooC) that @lennartfr and I created - check it out

## step one - create an account on IBM Cloud
- use (www.bluemix.net)[www.bluemix.net] to sign up for a free account

## step two - create one of the IBM Watson services

There are many AI services at the IBM Cloud available to use.

These labs use the following:
- Natural Language Understanding (the lite account)
- Visual Recognition (the regular account)
- Text to Speech (the regular account)

## step three - do the lab
Please choose the lab 1 (good also for the IBM Cloud lite accounts), 2 or 3 (these two are good for regular accounts only)

## next steps
Please try to complete the MooC course - check it out.
